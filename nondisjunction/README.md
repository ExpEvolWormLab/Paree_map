The nondusjunction.txt files contain the data from the assay done to estimate effect of rec-1 on chromosome non-disjunction.
  i.e., fertility, egg viability, male proportion in selfed progeny.

See methods of the genetics article for experimental details.

One row correspond to the data concerning self-fertilized progeny of a single hermaphrodite 
Columns:
-strain: 4 different strains; 2 rec-1 allele and 2 genetic backgrounds.
-block: 1 to 8;  independant assay
-eggs: the number of egg layed by the hermaphrodite.
-worms: the number of individuals having hatched from the initially layed eggs (counted in L4 or adults).
-males: the number of males among these individuals.
-background: the genetic background 
-rec: rec-1 allele of the strain; wt (wild-type) or mut (mutant).
